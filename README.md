# Statistical-Modelling-Project
This project focuses on analyzing if cases of fire breaking out have any influence on the cases of theft in the different areas of different zip codes in Chicago, USA. By collecting data about the rate of theft in each area and the frequency of fire breaking out, and using statistical methods to analyze this data, we can present a more intuitive data graph to depict the relationship between the fires and thefts to show how safe/dangerous an area is. This will eventually give people more inference and help them make a better housing choice. Regression analysis by Microsoft Excel and Minitab to analyze the correlation between the two variables; The independent variable/predictor The dependent variable X = Fires per 1000 housing units Y = Thefts per 1000 population The sample contains 42 elements (sample size) which are the different zip codes in the Chicago metro area. The reference for this data is from “Life in America's Small Cities, By G.S. Thomas” compiled by Cengage Learning.
